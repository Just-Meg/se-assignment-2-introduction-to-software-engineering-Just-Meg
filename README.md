# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:is the process od developing and testing computer applications to solve real world problems.  

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? This is the process of deployong,testibg and developing aplications. programming deals with writing codes to solve the problem while software engineering involves scientific and mathematical concepts to design a software
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. The following are the phases of the SDLC a) Planning-it involves defining the software purpose and scope in this this phase the developers strategize for execution 
b) Requirement Analysis- this phase aims at collecting,recording and identifying the requirements of the user. it helps understand the software functionality
c) Design- in this phase the frame work is built.
d) Coding- This phase aims to develop software tjat is functional,efficient and user friendly. an efficient programming language is selected and used.
e)-Testing- A thorough examination of the sofware is done to identify bugs or glitches that may have slipped during codding.this phase aims at ensuring flawless software operation before it gets to the user
f) Deployment- it involves giving out the software to the end user. this phase ensures that the users operate the software with ease by providing manuals, training sessions or offering on site support
f) Maintenance- it involves constant assistance or improvement to the softwae to ensure longevity of the sofware.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agileis open to adaptation and allows changes even during the last phases of development while Waterfall is does not allow changes during last phases of the project.
Agile is not suitable for projects with a defined end goal while waterfall is suitae for projects with defined end goal.
waterfall model is mainly used in the software engineering and product development while agile is mainly used when a project does not have a timeline
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is is the process of documenting,defining and maintaining requirement for the design engineering 
the proces of requirement  engineering are need,elicitation,analysis,negotiation,documentation,validation,use
requirement engineering is important because it onforms everyone involved with the project what is required
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
by dividing the software into modules hence developers can update and manage part of the software
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
testing is crucial because it improves consistency and performance 
unit testing is the process of testing the smallest functional unit code
integration testing is the process where mosules are tested together as one
system testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution
acceptance testing is a software testing that checks if a system meets its business and user requirements
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
 role effectively manage the software project, from start to finish
 
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
